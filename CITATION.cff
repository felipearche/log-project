The project emphasizes strict, auditable reproducibility:  UTF-8/LF policy, byte-exact protected JSONs, canonical data/HASHES.txt, 24-column experiments/summary.csv,  and CI-pinned environments.'keywords:- log anomaly detection- streaming- conformal prediction- ADWIN- reproducibility- TF-IDF- IsolationForest- Pythonauthors:- given-names: Felipe  family-names: Archepreferred-citation:  type: software  title: log-project  authors:  - given-names: Felipe    family-names: Arche  version: 0.1.3  date-released: '2025-09-17'  url: https://github.com/felipearche/log-project
